# Stock_Predicting_App

## 📈 Stock Analysis & Forecasting Hub

This is a personal project I built from scratch using **Python** and **Streamlit**, designed to help users analyze stock performance, explore technical indicators, and forecast future stock prices based on historical trends. The app combines real-time data analysis with predictive modeling to support smarter, data-driven investment decisions.
